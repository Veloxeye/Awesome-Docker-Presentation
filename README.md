# 1. Docker - https://www.docker.com/

Docker is a software that allows you to package software into standardized packages called containers for easy deployment. These containers contain everything the software needs to run including libraries, system tools, code, and runtime. These are isolated instances that contain their own file system and dependency structure that allows you to run an application on any operating system. This presents users with a suite of tools that can be used to develop ship and run applications with lightweight containers.

Pros: Docker containers share the host OS kernel, as opposed to isolating applications at the OS level.

Cons: Used for individual applications, as opposed to virtualizing an entire operating system.

# 2. Hyper V - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/virtualization/hyper-v/get-started/install-hyper-v?tabs=powershell&pivots=windows

Microsoft’s hardware virtualization software, allowing users to create and manage virtual machines with an independent OS to the physical machine. Hyper V however lacks snapshots, as well as live migration.

# 3. Unreal Engine - https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US

Unreal engine is a 3d game engine that allows users to have a basis physics and graphics rendering platform to begin building games off of as opposed to working with raw code. Unreal engine has a steep learning curve and requires powerful hardware for rendering, however has industry leading graphics.

# 4. Unity - https://unity.com/

Unity is a game engine, with easy to understand UI and scripts, making it very user friendly and a good first game engine to work with. Unity runs on C++, and is able to deliver high quality games without large hardware or storage requirements, however it is less developed in graphics than other engines like Unreal.

# 5. Procreate - https://procreate.com/

Procreate is an application that allows artists to create digital artworks with a variety of drawing tools and customization options. This allows for more customization than other applications like canva, however is often more time consuming and difficult as opposed to other apps with drag drop interfaces.

# 6. Blender - https://www.blender.org/

Blender is a software application that allows users to create 3d graphics, renders, and models for a multitude of different uses including game development and animation. This includes a variety of tools for modeling, sculpting, rigging, etc. While Blender is a near industry standard, it also has a steep learning curve and a complicated UI making it less user friendly to new animators.

# 7. Github - https://github.com/

Github is an application used for collaborative coding, and is widely loved for its tools for tracking changes, managing versions, and its open access to a multitude of repositories allowing for large open source projects. While this is extremely efficient for managing open source projects, its drawbacks are shown when attempting to store videos, images, pdfs, or other large binary files, as every revision of every file is stored locally.

# 8. Godot - https://godotengine.org/

Godot is an open source game engine that is used for a variety of development projects, but is most often used for making mobile and console games. Godot is often liked for being free, lightweight, and open source, however it has a lot of drawbacks in its 3d capabilities as well as a small asset marketplace. 

# 9. Speedtree - https://store.speedtree.com/?v=7516fd43adaa

Speedtree is the industry standard vegetation toolkit for game developers, and often even films. It has a variety of tools and options including manual art as well as procedural generation allowing it to be useful for anything from large open world games to small personal projects. Speedtree’s only real cons are its integration challenges, especially with UE5.

# 10. Polyhaven - https://polyhaven.com/

Polyhaven is an application providing a modicum of 3d assets including textures, models, and more. This makes Polyhaven a must have for many game developers, especially indie game devs working in smaller teams with less resources to create custom assets. With Polyhaven being an open library, some textures vary in quality, making many assets inconsistent and even sometimes causing issues with its blender add-on.
